# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses multiple ML models and an Artificial Neural Network to predict customer churn based on telco data.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost (with GridSearchCV)
- Artificial Neural Network (TensorFlow)
- Ensemble Voting Classifier

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTEENN
- Feature selection using RFE
- Model evaluation and comparison

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run script: `python churn_prediction.py`

## Dataset
Place the dataset in `data/Customer_churn_dataset.csv`
